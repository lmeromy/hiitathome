# hiitathome

A custom HIIT workout generator! No equipment required for these low-impact moves: perfect for at home, outside, or at the gym.

## To run this app:

1. In the terminal in the main directory, type `npm run dev` which will start the front end and back end simultaneously ( thanks to the `concurrently` package)
2. You should see the app open in your web browser at localhost:3000
3. To see the api, take a look at http://localhost:5000/api/exercises in your browser

### note: you will need to have installed all dependencies and will need to have an instance of postgres running. You will also need to configure your server to talk to your database. See the schema file (/database/schema.sql) for the database structure.

### reference the following tutorial for some explanations, though I did not use this tutorial to build this app:
